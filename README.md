# Robotic-Hand

## Project

- This Robotic arm will be controlled by one or two people using flex sencors or with the possiblity of using additional controls. The main purpose for the arm would be to pick up certain toxic objects that may be considered dangerous for humans to touch or come in contacted with. With this, hazardous chemicals could be handled and picked up just like any normal item. Possible uses include, being attached to a rover, used to test chemical reactions from a distance, additional virtual assistants, High-five people that are infectious, pet porcupines, etc.

## Plans and designs

- As of right now, we have 6 possible designs we could use and those designs could inspire more in the future. Three different ways to control the arm, and two ways of holding it in place (pictures in "Images"). Our drafts and thought processes are in "Links" aswell a CAD prototype.

## Project Updates

1. What major obstacle is keeping you from making better progress on your project?

### Issues related to Code

- The one major issue that is giving me problems with making good progress on our project is the continous issues I keep having with the USB cable. Its such a small issue, yet if I leave this problem unresolved, I will not be able to code. I don't know what causes this to happen, but the only solution that has worked in the past was to replacing the cable entirely. But since this problem has happened before and the USB cables cost money, going through multiple of them at a time is not ideal. 

- Due to the previous problem, I am not able to submit any of the code I have so far, but I will do so when the problem is fixed. Despite this, Note that I was makeing good progess with using flex sensors to rotate servo.
